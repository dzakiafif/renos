Coding/Design Test

1. You are tasked to create a microservice to process users data and user orders data. Both of these data is obtained through endpoints, not database access. One of the important steps of the data processing is to match each user with the user orders data. Assume that both data is already in-memory in the form of lists. How do you achieve the matching step?

2. You are tasked to create a brand new microservice for user domain (does anything that has to do with users data). The obvious task of the microservice is to save a newly registered user to the database. However, the product owner comes to you with the following additional requirements :
- After the user is successfully registered, send email to the marketing department, to notify them of a new user
- After the user is successfully registered, send a welcome email to the user
Assume that the related functions/methods already exists, and you just have to execute it. How do you achieve these requirements?

If, say, the project manager comes to you in the future with new tasks relating to successful user registration, how do you add these tasks to the list of execution? (assume that the functions/methods already exists). Let's say, as it goes, there are about 50-ish related tasks that need to be done right after the user has successfully registered.

You are free to propose a new approach/design. Please explain your approach.

#answer
1. i will make a new endpoint for process matching users data and user orders data
2. i will make a new service for handle send email and inject to function which handle save a newly registered user to database
